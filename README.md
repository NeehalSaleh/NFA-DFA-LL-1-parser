# NFA-DFA-LL-1-parser

This project consists of 2 parts:

- Part 1 (NFA_and_DFA):
First, we will build an NFA from a given regular expression, and then we will convert the giving NFA into a DFA.
Also, you can build a DFA from a given regular expression directly 


- Part 2 (LL(1)):
Here we were given a grammar that we modify (see the pdf).
Then we re-write the grammar such that it can be parsed by an LL(1) parser, and then we use the rewritten grammar as a base to implement LL(1) parser.
Part 1 was written in Java, and Part 2 was written in Python

-Both have a GUI.
